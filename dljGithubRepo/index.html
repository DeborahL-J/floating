    <h1><p align="center"> floating </h1>
 

<p>Growing up we’d always take a family vacation to Gulf Shores, and then later my parents retired to Mexico Beach. 
</p>

<p>Years of watching our dad floating on his back, arms out, gently riding small waves, face turned up to the sun. He would always relax into the ocean, riding the salt and the sun in utter contentment. 
</p>
  

    <p>As I get older</p>
<em> <p>fatter and more bouyant</p> </em>
    <p>I also find myself leaning back into the gentle embrace of Yellow Creek, the beach waves in Pensacola or even the pool in my sister’s neighborhood.  
    </p>

<p>Relax into the water.</p> 
<p>Nothing above but fingers and nose, tummy and toes. </p>
<p>Ride the small waves as the sun makes violet colored kisses on my closed lids. </p>
<p>Hearing birds and splashes and kids having fun.</p>
<p>Trusting that I’ll float safely. </p>
    <br>

   <p>Just me and the water.    </p> 
    <br>
      <em>Thank you, daddy.</em>
